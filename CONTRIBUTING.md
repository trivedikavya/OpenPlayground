# Contributing to OpenPlayground

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenPlayground! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

### ❌ DO NOT MODIFY `index.html` DIRECTLY!

OpenPlayground uses a **component-based architecture**. This means:

- ✅ **DO:** Add your project to `projects.json`
- ❌ **DO NOT:** Add project cards directly to `index.html`
- ❌ **DO NOT:** Add inline HTML/CSS to `index.html`
- ❌ **DO NOT:** Modify the component placeholders in `index.html`

**Why?** `index.html` is only 57 lines long and should stay that way. It dynamically loads:
- Components from `components/` folder (header, footer, etc.)
- Projects from `projects.json` file

**PRs that violate this rule will be rejected.**

### 📸 MANDATORY: Add Screenshots of Your Changes

- ✅ **ALWAYS** include screenshots showing your changes in the PR
- ✅ Show before/after screenshots if you're fixing a bug
- ✅ Show the UI working on both desktop and mobile if applicable
- ❌ PRs without screenshots may be rejected or delayed

### 🚫 DO NOT Modify Unrelated Files

- ✅ Only modify files that are directly related to your contribution
- ❌ **STRICTLY PROHIBITED:** Changing any file that is not part of your feature/fix
- ❌ Do not "clean up" or "format" other files
- ❌ Do not add random changes to existing code

**PRs with unnecessary file changes will be rejected.**

### 🤖 FOR LLM/AI USERS - IMPORTANT WARNING

If you are using AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.) to generate code:

- ⚠️ **ALWAYS review the generated code before committing**
- ⚠️ **CHECK that no unrelated files were modified**
- ⚠️ **VERIFY the changes make sense and don't break existing functionality**
- ⚠️ **TEST your changes locally before pushing**
- ⚠️ **Run `git diff` to see exactly what files changed**

**Tip:** Use `git status` and `git diff` before every commit to ensure only intended files are modified.

**PRs with AI-generated errors or unnecessary changes will be rejected.**

   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OpenPlayground.git
   cd OpenPlayground
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-project-name
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

1. **New Projects** - Add your own creative projects
2. **Bug Fixes** - Fix issues in existing projects
3. **Improvements** - Enhance existing projects or the main website
4. **Documentation** - Improve README files or add project documentation
5. **Design** - Improve the visual design of projects or the main site

### Adding a New Project

1. **Create your project folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir projects/your-project-name
   cd projects/your-project-name
   ```

2. **Required files**
   - `index.html` - Main HTML file
   - `style.css` - CSS styles
   - `script.js` - JavaScript functionality
   - `README.md` - Project documentation (optional but recommended)

3. **Update projects.json**
   - ❌ **DO NOT** add your project to `index.html`
   - ✅ **DO** add your project to `projects.json` (see Submission Process section)
   - Choose an appropriate icon from [RemixIcon](https://remixicon.com/)
   - Select the correct category for your project

## Project Guidelines

### Technical Requirements

- **Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks unless absolutely necessary)
- **Make it responsive** - Ensure your project works on mobile devices
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Clean code** - Use proper indentation and meaningful variable names
- **Comments** - Add comments to explain complex logic

### Quality Standards

- **Functionality** - Your project should work as intended without errors
- **User Experience** - Intuitive and easy to use
- **Performance** - Optimize images and minimize file sizes
- **Accessibility** - Follow basic accessibility guidelines
- **Security** - Avoid any security vulnerabilities

### Content Guidelines

- **Original work** - Don't copy projects directly from tutorials or other sources
- **Appropriate content** - No offensive, inappropriate, or harmful content
- **Educational value** - Projects should demonstrate programming concepts or solve problems
- **Documentation** - Include clear descriptions and usage instructions

### File Structure

```
projects/your-project-name/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file (MUST be directly in project folder)
├── style.css           # CSS styles
├── script.js           # JavaScript code
├── README.md           # Project documentation (optional)
└── assets/             # Images, fonts, etc. (if needed)
    ├── image1.jpg
    └── icon.svg
```

**Important:** Place `index.html` directly in your project folder (e.g., `projects/your-project-name/index.html`). Do not create subfolders unless necessary (e.g., for full-stack projects with separate frontend/backend). The link in `projects.json` should point to `./projects/your-project-name/index.html`.

## Submission Process

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Develop your project**
   - Create your project in the `projects/` directory
   - Test thoroughly on different devices and browsers
   - Ensure all files are properly organized

2. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Add to projects.json (NOT index.html!)**
   - Open `projects.json` in the root directory
   - ❌ **DO NOT TOUCH `index.html`** - it auto-generates from `projects.json`
   - Add a new object to the array with your project details:

   ```json
   {
      "title": "Your Project Name",
      "category": "utility",
      "description": "Brief description of your project (max 100 chars).",
      "tech": ["HTML", "CSS", "JS"],
      "link": "./projects/your-project-name/index.html",
      "icon": "ri-your-icon-name",
      "coverClass": "your-project-cover"
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Valid categories include `utility`, `game`, `puzzle`, `productivity`, etc.
   
   **Icon Names:** Browse [RemixIcon](https://remixicon.com/) and use the full class name (e.g., `ri-calculator-line`)

3. **Validate your submission**
   - Run the validation script to ensure your project link is correct:
     ```bash
     node validate-links.js
     ```
   - If there are broken links, fix the folder structure or link in `projects.json`

4. **Add CSS for your project card**

   - If you used a `coverClass` (e.g., `your-project-cover`) in step 2, add the styling in `css/style.css` :

   ```copy
         .your-project-cover {
         background: linear-gradient(135deg, #color1 0%, #color2 100%);
         color: white; /* Optional: adjust text color if needed */
         }
   ```
   - Alternatively, you can use `"coverStyle"` in `projects.json` for inline styles instead of a class.
   

4. **Test your changes**
   - Open `index.html` in a browser (or use a local server)
   - Your project card should appear automatically in the projects section
   - Verify the card displays correctly (icon, title, description, category)
   - Click your card to ensure it opens your project
   - Test your project functionality thoroughly
   - Check browser console for any errors
   

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Your Project Name - Brief description"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-project-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Fill out the PR template with details about your project
   - Submit the pull request
